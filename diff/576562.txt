 - Firewall setting~
 Firstly, add firewall rules to pass HTTP/HTTPS, for example
  $ sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
  $ sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
 NOTE: Don't forget to allowing SSH when you constructing your environment with remote login like Amazon EC2.
  $ sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
 Enable firewall.
  $ sudo ufw enable
  $ sudo systemctl restart ufw
 
 - Install web-related packages~
 Install apache2 and PHP for using HTML and PHP-based services (e.g. PukiWiki).
  $ sudo apt-get install apache2
 Create a sample file,
  $ sudo apt-get install php
  $ sudo emacs -nw /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
 something like this.
  <?php
   phpinfo();
  ?>
 
 
 
 * Basic Authentication [#nbdfed1b]
 You can control web-accesses to your pages with simply using ".htaccess" and ".htpasswd". 
-This authentication would be not recommended when you have root the privilege of the web-server, because you can directly edit web setting files such as "apache.conf".
+This authentication would be not recommended when you have the root privilege of the web-server, because you can directly edit web setting files such as "apache.conf".
 
+When you enable ".htaccess", you need to modify "httpd.conf" or "apache2.conf" and give accessibility to the targeted directories. For example, in "/etc/apache2/apache2.conf",
+
+ <Directory /var/www/>
+        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
+        AllowOverride All # added
+ #      AllowOverride None # commented out
+        Require all granted
+ </Directory>
+
 This is an example of ".htaccess". &ref(htaccess_hayamizu.example,,example);
 
 - How to create ".htpasswd"~
 When you type,
  $ sudo htpasswd -nb ID PASSWARD
 you will get the following text. The part of password is converted with MD5 hash-function.
  ID:$apr1$7JqxFDLM$gezHr1Fed8tMSILzG4U/J.
 You just copy&pate this text to a new ".htpasswd" file in the directory which you specified in ".htaccess" file.
 
 - Firewall setting~
 You can deny/allow accesses from specific hosts by writing the following lines to your ".htaccess" file.
  Allow from localhost
  Allow from 192.168.1.1
 If you want to close/open specific directories, you can write like,
  <Files ~ "^\.(htaccess|htpasswd)$">
  Deny from all
  </Files>
 This secure setting would be highly recommended.
