* Background
  
- AQM (Active Queue Management) mechanisms
  - Studied by many researchers
  - Supports the congestion control mechanism of TCP
  
- RED (Random Early Detection)
  - A representative AQM mechanism
  - Randomly discards an arriving packet
    - Keeps the average queue length small
    - Achieves high throughput
  - Its operation algorithm is quite simple
  
* RED Known Problems
  
- Parameter sensitivity
  - Effectiveness is dependent on four control parameters
  - Average queue length is dependent on traffic load
    - i.e., the number of active TCP connections
  
- Parameter tuning difficulty
  - The optimal control parameters is affected by traffic load
  
- More understanding on RED is necessary
  
* RED Packet Marking Probability
  
- RED randomly discards an arriving packet with a probability proportional to its average queue length
  
* Question on RED Packet Marking Probability
  
- Analytically known facts
  - TCP throughput is inversely proportional to p^(1/2)
    - p: the packet loss probability in the network
  - For M/M/1 queueing system, the average queue length is (rho/(1-rho))
    - rho: utilization factor
  - So, should the packet marking probability not be changed linearly?
  
- Question
  - For achieving good steady state and transient state performances...
  - Whether the packet marking probability should be proportional to the average queue length or not? 
  
* Objectives
  
- Investigate effect of packet marking function on RED's performance
  - Steady state performance
  - Transient state performance
  
- Show how the packet marking function should be determined
  - Utilize analytic results of TCP and RED steady state analysis
  
- Consider three classes of packet marking functions
  - Linear, concave, and convex
  - Show which packet marking functions is the best...
    - in terms of good transient state performance and robustness
  
* Analysis Overview
  
- 1. Replace the packet marking function with a generic one
  
- 2. Combining two analytic models
  - Stochastic model of TCP window size
  - Deterministic model of RED queue length
  
- 3. Analyze toward what value the average queue length converges...
  - for a given average queue length
  
* 1. Replace Packet Marking Function and Define Queue Occupancy
  
- The packet marking function is replaced by
  - (2)
  
- Introduce ``queue occupancy''
  
* 2. Combining Two Analytic Models
  
- Expected value of TCP window size: w(p)
  - (3)
  - (4)
  - b: the number of packets required for returning an ACK packet
  - p: the packet loss probability in the network
  
- Queue length of RED in steady state: qavg
  - (5)
  - N: the number of TCP connections
  - w: TCP window size
  - B: maximum transmission capacity of RED router
  - tau: two-way propagation delay of TCP connection
  
* 3. Analyze Average Queue Length Convergence Point
  
- Average queue length convergence point: qavg
  - (8)
- Queue occupancy in steady state: x^*
  - (9)
  
* Effect of Packet Marking Function
  
- Fig. 2
  
* Optimal Packet Marking Function
  
- Packet marking function should be chosen such that Eq. (9) becomes a linear function 
  - (10)
  
- By solving the above equation, we have
  - (11)
  
- To optimize the steady state and transient state performances...
  - f(x) must be changed according to N
  - N: the number of active TCP connections
  
- However, Eq. (11) is impractical...
  - since RED router has no capability to know the number of active TCP connections
  
* Three Function Classes: Linear, Concave, Convex
  
- Linear
  - Eq (11)
  
- Concave
  - Eq (12)
  
- Convex
  - Eq. (13)

* RED Queue Occupancy (Convex Case)

  - Steady state performance
  - Transient state performance
  
- Show how the packet marking function should be determined
  - Utilize analytic results of TCP and RED steady state analysis
