No. There is no modeling/analysis of video quality in the proposed transport protocol. It is not convincing that this protocol can improve video 
quality. Most of the readers in the video area will not be interested in this paper.

This paper proposes a redundancy window-based transport protocol for real-time video streaming over content oriented networks. However, the 
reviewer fails to see the contributions and novelty of this paper due to the fundamental and serious flaws in the current manuscript.
 Please see the detailed comments.

The topic of video streaming over content oriented networks is interesting but the reviewer cannot accept this paper due to the serious flaws and poor 
presentation.

> *** Weaknesses: What are the most important reasons NOT to accept the 
paper?

This paper is seriously flawed in the basic assumption, system design, mathematical modeling, and simulations. Besides, this manuscript is full 
of typos and errors. The reviewer fails to see the novelty and contributions.

This paper proposes a redundancy window-based transport protocol for content oriented networks. However, this manuscript is seriously flawed in the 
basic assumption, mathematical modeling and simulations. Besides, this paper is poorly written with numerous typos and inappropriate English 
usage. The reviewer fails to see the contributions and novelty. Detailed comments are as follows.
1. The transport protocol in this paper is for content oriented networks. However, the authors do not justify the differences of this protocol with 
previous transport protocols in TCP/IP suite, e.g., MPLOP [37]. The transport protocol for CCN/NDN should be fundamentally different form those 
in TCP/IP suite since the IP address is no longer used. The authors do not justify such difference throughout the paper and the reviewer fails to see 
the novelty of this manuscript.  

2. The system design is also seriously flawed. As shown in Fig. 2, the FEC source block length is controlled by the streaming application, i.e., at 
application layer. If this paper proposes a transport protocol, why is the FEC coding parameter set at application layer? 

3. If the proposed transport protocol is designed for real-time video, the video quality model should be considered. However, there is no such 
modeling/analysis in Section III. The readers and reviewers cannot understand why this protocol can improve video quality. 

4. The evaluation part is problematic and not convincing:
[a] what is the delay constraint for real-time video in the simulations is 
not mentioned at all. 
[b] The authors use SVC for real-time video compression. However, it is widely acknowledged that SVC is of low coding efficiency and not suitable 
for real-time video applications due to the long coding delay. Please check the references and use the H.264/AVC codecs, e.g., FFMPEG/x264.
[c] The PSNR measurement is completely wrong. In Equation (10), the authors only consider bitrate and throughput in measuring PSNR. Where is the delay 
constraint? Delay is an important factor for the real-time video PSNR since the overdue video frames will induce quality degradation.   

5. In the Introduction part, the authors state the delay constraint of 150 ms according to ITU-T G.114 [29]. However, ITU-T G.114 is for voice 
applications. Please check this reference carefully. 

6. This paper is full of typos/errors and not ready for review:
[a] In the abstract: "It is desired..." should be "It is desirable...", "is 
coming...." should be "is becoming....."
[a] In the references, there are errors like "in Proc. IEEE/ACM Trans. 
Networking", "in Proc. IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory",  "in Proc. IEEE 
Trans. Broadcasting". Please do not make such simple mistakes and check 
the paper carefully before submission.  

7. This paper is full of long and ambiguous sentences, e.g., the second 
sentence in the abstract: "This trend necessitates increased robustness 
against data loss, because the perceived quality of video compressed with a 
higher compression ratio is more strongly affected by data loss, and 
furthermore, network loss is inevitable as long as 
........"
Please spend more time learning English and scientific paper writing. Such 
presentation is really unacceptable.

delay-sensitive video transmission. The

The authors have failed to justify their claims.

In the paper the authors propose a transport layer protocol specialized for high-quality delay-sensitive video streaming. They design a scheme that 
jointly adapts data rate and redundancy of the transmitted video, to different network conditions estimated based on packet reception events. 
After introducing the detailed protocol, they further discuss the adoption of the proposed protocol in content-centric networks. Simulations results 
are also provided to show the performance. The work is systematic, with both design and evaluation. 
However, the authors have failed to justify their claims. There is no theoretical analysis or comparison with other protocols that show the advantages claimed by them, so the value of the work remains mysterious. The reviewer thinks more efforts must be spent on it before publication. Listed comments are listed below:
1. The major weakness of the paper is the gap between the proposed protocol 
and the claims. The authors describe the protocol in detail in section 
III, but it is far from obvious how the proposed protocol overcomes the 
challenges and meets the requirements described in section II. For 
example, a. It is mentioned that, for rate control, “the main challenge is to design an appropriate rate control mechanism that can 
achieve stable data transmission with as high a data rate as possible, while 
avoiding quality degradation caused by data losses”, but the 
protocol does not reveal how the objective of stable data transmission is 
achieved. Especially, what does “stable data transmission” 
refer to; b. In II.B the authors mention that an issue to be addressed 
is how different streaming flows compete cooperatively. But in section III 
this is completely omitted.
2. The reviewer is not sure if the underlying assumption is valid. The authors argue that data loss is inevitable. It is true, however, video is 
typically quite robust to data loss. Even for very high-quality video it is not necessary to guarantee perfect transmission. So the reviewer 
strongly doubts whether it is necessary to introduce such a “generous” redundancy (up to 200% overhead is allowed, according to the authors) to guarantee the perfect recovery of the data packets.
3. The rate adaptation scheme is not very satisfying in the opinion of the reviewer. The authors try to always maintain a high redundancy (with a 
code rate no greater than 2/3), this will for sure introduce unnecessary overhead under certain conditions.
4. In the evaluation there is no comparison between the proposed protocol and the its counterparts reviewed in section I. So there is no clue how 
this protocol fits the scenario with high-quality delay-sensitive video.
5. In Fig. 1, what does “averaged link utilization” refer to exactly? What do you mean by saying “averaged over the round trip time”?

This paper proposes a redundancy-based transport protocol (REDTP) to 
implement high-quality delay-sensitive video streaming in content-centric 
network (CCN) or named-data network (NDN), which is within the scope of the 
special issue.

To support robust high-quality delay-sensitive video streaming in CCN/NDN, 
the authors propose a new transport protocol by leveraging the FEC 
redundancy window size to further control the data rate and received video 
quality. The topic is important for robust video streaming in Future 
Internet, however, the idea is not novel. Besides, some key ideas 
description or theoretical analysis are not well addressed in this paper, 
which lowers the technical depth.

> *** Strengths: What are the major reasons to accept the paper?

Different scenarios are considered in the evaluation part to validate the 
proposed idea.

> *** Weaknesses: What are the most important reasons NOT to accept the 
paper?

The theoretical analysis is not rigorous and some key points are not clearly 
addressed.

> *** Detailed Comments: Please provide detailed comments that will be 
helpful to the Guest Editors for assessing the paper. Also provide 
feedback to the authors.

First, the proposed REDTP algorithm is not clearly and well elaborated. 

1.	The adjustment of produced data rate k is simple and fixed in the 
evaluation section. 
2.	What the authors are trying to handle is the number of FEC packets, 
F_wnd, through which to control the total data rate injected to the 
Internet. However, how to achieve the high-quality video streaming is not 
intuitive by controlling F_wnd, especially in the highly congested 
scenario. 
3.	In Sec. III.D, the analysis of the increase/decrease algorithm for W_tot 
is not rigorous. The equation (8) derived from (3) and (7) is not 
corrected. From the reviewer’s view, (8) is only suitable for the 
equilibrium point (W_tot^*). Therefore, the data rate control based on 
W_tot in Sec. III.E is not convincing. 
4.	The whole Sec. III.D needs more work to make it clear and concise. The 
impact of the F_wnd on the video quality is facially treated and not 
clear. 

Second, the integration of REDTP into the CCN/NDN is simple. 
1.	The utilization of “symbolic interest” to consider the 
timing of interest issue is not creative. 
2.	In Sec. IV.D, the authors claimed that REDTP needs to consider minimizing 
buffering and processing delay. How to implement this should be 
specified. Only adapting the number of F_wnd without executing re-encoding 
or decoding the original data according to the link state is not 
convincing. In this case, the error may accumulate and thus affecting the 
video quality. 
3.	In Sec. IV.E, to avoid the burst loss, the authors don’t use the 
algorithm in Sec. III.D. The authors should explain why just simply 
decreasing W_tot by \Delta T/N and compare this with the algorithm in Sec. 
III.D. 

Third, the evaluation of the proposed REDTP is not enough. What does the 
redundancy rate mean? Please clarify this. Besides, the results showing 
the video quality curve with respect to the F_wnd should be added to 
convince the readers. 

The last but not least, the presentation should be further improved. 
1.	Page 2, right column, Fig. 2.1 -> Fig. 1.
2.	Page 5, dec should be first defined. 
3.	Page 7, Sec. IV.E, face -> Face. 
and among others.
